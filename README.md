# RestaurantProject
Python project that simulates restaurant customers coming and going. This python project includes:
- A random timer that simulates the random times when customers will come in
- Every time chunk that passes, customers will move forward in the progression of ordering, paying, and leaving
- Customers can order from a set list of items and their totals will be calculated
- Customers will then pay
- This progression will continue until the restaurant closes

This project was a culmination of the Python concepts I learned.
